                We aspire to help our community first and foremost.
				I want to be able to use my knowledge of electronics 
				and IT to give people a face they can trust without 
				having to worry about breaking the bank or getting 
				ripped off by some shop wanting seventy dollars 
				just to diagnose a device. I have been around this 
				industry for over five years and have never liked the 
				way most shops charge an arm and a leg just to get in 
				the door. I know how important it can be to keep your 
				pc up and running, and hate the predatory tatics of 
				some shops. Thats why I created ZF Computer Services 
				to help combat those people and hopefully make the 
				industry I love a better place, and keep my community
				up and running.
