# ZF Computer Services
 A fully responsive website created by me for ZF Computer Services

The Initial commit is the 1.1 version of the website, if you would like to view this live just visit http://zfcompservices.000webhostapp.com/index.html
This is my first major project, and is being updated by me very frequently. I am doing all of the graphic design, website design and development. Also the website is fully responsive with no media queries!

This website is designed as an informative small business website for ZF Computer Services. This project is made out of just HTML and CSS, no JS. It is fully responsive, and has been tested on all major browsers.
