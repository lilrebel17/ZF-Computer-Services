### Current Focus

* Continuing to remove ids as ive found they just make the whole thing a bit messy and hard to edit
* Adding custom properties for things I have been using a lot, like swapping background colors or text colors
* Revising a lot of the documents at the moment as I found a much better way to keep everything readable & streamline a lot of lines of code. This will also help improve load times for lower end devices or worsening connections.
